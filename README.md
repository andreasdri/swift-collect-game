Santa needs your help! A mean-spirited crook of a man has stolen all the Christmas
presents, and flies around in the sky throwing gifts to the ground. Collect all
the presents and save Christmas. (In other words, a barely working, shitty game based 
on some tutorials to learn the basics of Swift and SpriteKit)

## Setup

Clone, open `CollectGame.xcodeproj`, click on run.
